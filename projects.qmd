## Project 1
Last month I added high fiving to the list of tricks I can do. It didn't take very long and now I will run across the room to high five you if you ask.

## Project 2
I am almost leash trained! Now that I am comfortable with my harness, the next steps are learning how to gain courage to explore the outside.
